# Dependencies
You need **CommandAPI** to be able to use plugins' commands in datapacks, the **TGCPlugin**, and **DiscordSRV + an add-on** to add a /move command.
It is possible to bypass these dependencies if you just remove every non-vanilla commands from the datapack, it will not break it, as they do actions independently (like glowing players, moving them from a voice channel to another,...)
